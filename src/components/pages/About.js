          Hello! My name is Adam Johnson. I live in the beautiful Smoky Mountains of North Carolina 
          with my wife and two wild little boys. I have professional experience in multiple industries- 
          the most experience being in Automotive and Locomotive Engineering. I enjoy spending time with my family, 
          fishing, gardening, blacksmithing, and any kind of craft that involves using my hands. 
          I recently decided to pursue new opportunities with the UNC Coding Boot Camp. 
          I have a love for computers and understanding how things work that spans at least twenty years. 

          Please feel free to review my portfolio and to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a project. 
          I look forward to working with you!
